## Hi there, I'm Christina Maroun ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m pursuing a data science fellowship. For Phase 1 of the program, I created data analysis projects in Python and participated in healthcare-based hackathons. In Phase 2, I built machine learning pipeline projects. For Phase 3, I worked on an education capstone project that involved six sprints. The focus was on NYC high school education outcomes post-COVID and post-AI. Currently, I am in Phase 4 (Alumni) of the fellowship, focusing on continued learning, networking, and seeking future opportunities.
